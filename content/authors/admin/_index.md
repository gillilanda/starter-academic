Amy Gilliland is an Assistant Mapping Geologist with the Washington Geological Survey. In the field, her responsibilities include assisting the lead geologist with geologic data collection, geologic landscape interpretation, and geophysical data acquisition in Kittitas County, WA as part of the STATEMAP program. Additional responsibilities include remote sensing of the landscape using ArcGIS with an emphasis on landslides, escarpments, and other quaternary features.

Amy is also a graduate student with Central Washington Universityâ€™s Geological Science Department. Her research involves investigating the spatial variations of surface morphology in the Transantarctic Mountains, Antarctica to improve scientific understanding of climate and tectonic events. She expects to graduate with her M.S. in Winter 2021.
